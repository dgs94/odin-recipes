        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the pork shoulder by trimming any excess fat from the roast. (Too much fat won't render, leaving an overly greasy finished product)</li>
            <li>Pat the roast dry with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>Evenly coat the pork with the oil.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together the salt, pepper and garlic.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the pork with the seasoning mix and rub the mix into all areas of the meat to evenly cover.</li>
            <li>Cut the onion into 1/4" thick slices using a mandolin or sharp knife.</li>
            <li>Line the bottom of your slow cooker with a bed of onions.</li>
            <li>Place the pork shoulder into the slow cooker and top with remaining onions.</li>
            <li>At the side of the slow cooker, pour roughly 3 cups of Dr.Pepper to fill the slow cooker 3/4 of the way.</li>
            <li>Brush exposed pork with bbq sauce.</li>
            <li>Top slow cooker with lid and cook on low for 8 hours or high for 4.</li>
            <li>A couple of times throughout the cook, rotate and rebrush with bbq sauce as needed.</li>
            <li>Pork shoulder is done when it is tender and easily pulled with a fork.</li>
            <li>Strain the liquid from the cooker and using two forks shred the meat.</li>
            <li>Mix with shredded pork with bbq sauce as desired.</li>
            <li>Bon Appetit!</li>
